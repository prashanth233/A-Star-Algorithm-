# A-Star-Algorithm

The most common pathfinding object is Astar algorithm since it is versatile and may be applied in a variety of situations. Astar may be used to determine the shortest path, much like Dijkstra's Algorithm. Astar can utilise a heuristic to steer itself, similar to Greedy Best-First-Search. The key to its success is that it combines the information that Greedy Best-First-Search and Dijkstra's Algorithm employ, prioritising vertices that are near to the beginning point (favoring vertices that are close to the goal). According to accepted nomenclature, h(n) stands for the heuristic-estimated cost from vertex n to the target, while g(n) indicates the actual cost of the path from the starting point to any vertex n. As it advances from the beginning point to the objective, a star balances the two. Every time the main loop is executed, the vertex with the lowest f(n) = g(n) + h is examined (n).

Python was used to implement the A* search algorithm. also created a tool to view the a star pathfinding algorithm in action. Being an educated search algorithm, the Astar pathfinding algorithm is far more effective than conventional algorithms like breadth-first search or depth-first search. The final result is seen below.
